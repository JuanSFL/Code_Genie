  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  This is a full stack web application built for users in mind. Specifically coders. When a user has an issue that they can't solve, they can rely on code genie and it's community of members to help answer any questions they may have. If they are short on time and can't wait for someone to answer, we've came up with a solution! Our app comes  equipped with chatGPT's newest api to allow users to quickly get a response to any question they post!
